Kata in ruby that does a basic minesweeper clone. 

1. State rows and columns for your field "<rows> <columns>" (e.g. "3 4")
2. Insert what is a mine and what is not.
 * = mine
 . = blank tile
So for a 3 x 4 tile, it could look like so:
  ..*.
  ....
  **.*
3. Profit! It will return the number of surrounding tiles that have a mine for the locations where a mine does not exist.
